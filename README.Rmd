# rucoin

An API to KuCoin Crytocurrency Exchange data and market orders.

**Currently only have supports for getting market data, and still in heavy development stage!**

## Installation

You can install the development version of `rucoin` using:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bagasbgy/rucoin")
```

## Getting Started

For getting market data, you can use `get_kucoin_prices()`:

```{r example}
# import library
library(rucoin)

# get one pair of symbol prices
prices <- get_kucoin_prices(
  symbols = "KCS/USDT",
  from = ymd_hms("2019-06-01 00:00:00"),
  to = ymd_hms("2019-06-02 00:00:00"),
  frequency = "1 hour"
)

prices
```

## Further Development
